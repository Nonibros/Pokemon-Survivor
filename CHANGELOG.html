<h1 style="text-align: center;">Pokémon Survivor Change Log</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;">Latest update: July 16th, 2016</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This change log is for the Pokémon Firered hack, Pokémon Survivor by Nonibros. The thread containing the details on the project can be found <a href="404.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://github.com/Nonibros/Pokemon-Survivor">here</a> for the GitHub project.</p>

<h1>A few things</h1>

<p>Thank you everyone for your interest in this project!</p></br>

<p>I hope everyone who played the survivor game on Pokecommunity with me plays and enjoys this. I also hope anyone who <b>didn't</b> play still gets some enjoyment.</p>

<p>If you have any features or suggestions for the project, PM Nonibros on the <a href="http://www.pokecommunity.com/">forums</a>.</p>

<p>If you find any bugs, or there are broken parts of the game, PM Nonibros on the <a href="http://www.pokecommunity.com/">forums</a>.</p>

<h2>Key Notes</h2>

<h3>Note</h3>

<ul>
<li>The only time I change the X in X.Y.Z in the version number is when something REALLY major happens. This can be either a huge overall graphics improvement, or the addition of some major ASM Code that changes everything. I may also use this for sections or events in game where I feel a breakpoint is needed.</li></br>
<li>After major in-game events, say the first question, the increment will be the Y in X.Y.Z.</li></br>
<li>After regular changes like adding a tile or just some words or part of a challenge, the increment will be the Z in X.Y.Z.</li></br>
</ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>There will be <b>2</b> Hidden Immunity dolls in the game.</p>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<h3>These issues are known by the developers and are being worked on.</h3>

<ul>
<li>Nothing so far, I just need to fix the first map, and get a patch out.</li>
</ul>

<h3>These issues are known by the developers but won't be fixed.</h3>

<ul>
<li>I forsee when the NPC's are moving to get keys/notes in the game, you may be able to walk through them.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Some Ideas</h2>

<h3>Ideas</h3>

<ul>
<li>Make NPC's walk around while finding keys/notes.</li>
<li>Randomize the people in the game, so that no two games are exactly alike.</li>
<li>Set up the amount of teams.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Planned Releases</h2>

<p>These will be numbered releases that will be released when their key features are finished.</p>

<h3>Version [0.0.1] Release</h3>
