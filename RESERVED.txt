This is a file displaying what variables have already been used, and what can be used.

Now for the reserved section.

Special offsets:
0x780000 is a special offset.
We use this for anything NOT programmed yet, so that when the game is complete and there are beta testers or players, they can say "Dude, the blah on map blah told me to tell you that it doesn't work."
This is used as a sort of correction system, so that if errors in the game are found, they can be fixed.

This is a script for the very first map. Only Nonibros or someone very trusted can use this.
It sets all necessary flags to 1. Useful for hiding NPCs, like professor oak in his lab, at the very beginning of the game.
Script:

' As soon as we start the game, this activates.
' This is used to set certain people IDs that shouldn't show up at the beginning of the game. Example is professor Oak in his lab.
' Set this level script to type 04, Validates values...
' In Advance Map, set "Flag:" to "5001" and set "Value:" to "0000"
